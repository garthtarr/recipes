# Sauteed Eggplant with Peppers (Kerala Recipe)

### Ingredients

* Purple Eggplant – 1 large
* Diced Onions – 1
* Minced Garlic – 2 cloves
* Diced Tomatoes – 2
* Diced Sweet Mini Peppers – 1 cup (Alternatively, use Red Bell Peppers)
* Oil – 1 tbsp + 1 tbsp
* Tomato Paste – 1 tbsp
* Vinegar – 1 tsp
* Red Chilly Powder – 1 tsp
* Black Pepper Powder – 1/4 tsp
* Salt – to taste

### Procedure

1. Peel the eggplant and dice it into bite-sized pieces. Rinse the pieces and drain it thoroughly. Toss the pieces with a little salt.
2. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wide skillet and add the eggplant pieces in a single layer. Allow it to cook and then give it a stir after 2 minutes. Continue doing this for 6-7 minutes so that the eggplant is soft yet holds shape. Remove the eggplants from the skillet. Keep aside.
3. Add 1 more tablespoon of oil to the same pan. Throw in the diced onions. Saute until translucent.
4. Add the minced garlic and tomatoes. Stir and cook until the tomatoes are soft. Throw in the diced peppers and saute for 3-4 minutes.
5. Reduce heat and add 1 tsp of red chilly powder and stir fry for a minute.
6. Add 1 tbsp of tomato paste and 1 tsp of vinegar along with the cooked egg plants. Sprinkle 1/4 tsp of black pepper powder. Add salt to taste.
7. Cook for another 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally until the eggplant is very soft and most of the pieces have been mashed.

### Hints

* I omitted the onion and used lemon juice instead of vinegar.
