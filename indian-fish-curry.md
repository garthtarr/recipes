# Methi wali Machhli

### Ingredients

* 400 gm firm white fish steaks (Rohu. Catla any firm fish)
* 1 cup slightly sour yogurt
* 1/4 cup roughly chopped onion
* 3-4 garlic cloves
* 2-3 dry red chillies (or to taste - keep more than you think right as yogurt neutralises chillies)
* 1 tbsp coriander powder
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 1/2 cup packed finely chopped fenugreek leaves
* salt to taste
* 2-3 tbsp mustard oil
* fenugreek seeds about a dozen

### Procedure

1. Make a paste of the onion, garlic, red chillies and 1/4 cup of yogurt. Add the coriander and turmeric powder. Add salt to taste and pour or spoon this paste over the fish steaks in a mixing bowl. Add the chopped fenugreek leaves to the mixture, mix well and refrigerate for 2 hours.
2. Blend 1/4 cup yogurt in the same "mixie jar" and keep aside.
3. Heat mustard oil in a pan and add the fenugreek seeds. Wait till they become fragrant but take care not to brown them.  Drain the fish steaks from the marinade and fry both sides lightly in this hot oil. Drain and keep aside.
4. To the remaining oil add all the marinade and bhuno (fry under low to medium heat) till the oil separates. It takes about 4-5 minutes and the mixture becomes aromatic. When the oil separates from the cooking mixture, add the remaining yogurt, mix well and add about 1.5 cups of water. Bring the sauce to a soft boil before adding the fried fish steaks.  Cover and simmer for about 5-7 minutes or till the oil floats on top.
5. Serve with boiled rice.

### Hints

* I used ling for the fish and full-fat greek yoghurt.
*  I used frozen fenugreek leaves.  After defrosting, I squeezed out the liquid (water) and added them to the yoghurt mixture.  This makes more of a paste than a sauce.  (If you leave the water in, the sauce ends up too watery.)  This makes it easier to scrape off the marinade.
* Soon after starting the frying, the fish gives off a lot of liquid and then poaches.  This could be avoided by not marinading the fish but that may have other disadvantages.
*  The bhuno process does not work so well with the drier sauce based on frozen leaves.  I just fried it for a while and that seemed okay.
*  A dash of cream at the end adds a nice richness.
