# Pizza dough

### Ingredients

* 1 tsp dried yeast (active)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* 100ml warm water
* 2 tsp olive oil
* 160g plain flour

### Procedure

1. Put yeast, salt, sugar and warm water in a bowl and whist until just combined.
2. Gradually whisk in the olive oil then leave in a warm place for 10 mins or until the mixture starts to bubble.
3. Add flour and knead for 15 mins or until dough is smooth and elastic.
4. Coat the inside of a large bowl with olive oil. Roll the dough around in the bowl to coat it with oil, then place in the bowl, cover with a cloth and leave for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.
5. Punch down the dough to expel trapped air. (Optional: wrap in gladwrap and refrigerate or freeze - bring back to room temp before continuing.)
