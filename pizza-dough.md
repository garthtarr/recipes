# Pizza dough

### Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon dried yeast (active)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon sugar (or honey)
* 100ml warm water (hot tap water)
* 2 tsp olive oil
* 1 1/2 cup (190g) plain flour

### Procedure

1. Put yeast, salt, sugar and warm water in a bowl and whisk until just combined.
2. Gradually whisk in the olive oil then leave in a warm place for 10 mins or until the mixture starts to bubble.
3. Stir to dissolve yeast.  Add half the flour and stir.  Stir in as much of the rest of the flour as needed to make a stiff dough that can no longer be stirred.  Knead in the remaining flour for 10 mins or until dough is smooth and elastic but still tacky.
4. Coat the inside of a large bowl with olive oil. Roll the dough around in the bowl to coat it with oil, then place in the bowl, cover with a cloth and leave for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.
5. Punch down the dough to expel trapped air. (Optional: wrap in gladwrap and refrigerate or freeze - bring back to room temp before continuing.)
6. Place dough on a baking tray lined with baking paper, cover and leave for 15 mins or until risen by half again.
7. Roll dough out on bench top.

### Hints

Makes two small pizza bases.
