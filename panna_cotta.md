# Spinach Tart

### Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups (375ml) pouring cream
* 1 1/2 cups (375ml) milk
* 1 Masterfoods vanilla bean
* 1/2 cup (115g) caster sugar
* 2 1/2 teaspoons gelatine powder
* Strawberries, blueberries and raspberries

### Procedure

1. Place the cream and milk in a saucepan. Use a small sharp knife to split the vanilla bean lengthways, then scrape the seeds from inside the bean. Add the seeds and bean to the saucepan. Slowly bring to the boil over a medium heat. Remove from the heat and set aside for 10 minutes.
2. Discard bean from cream mixture. Add sugar and return to a low heat. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until sugar dissolves.
3. Place 2 tablespoons of boiling water in a small heatproof bowl. Sprinkle over gelatine (note that gelatine is measured in teaspoons not tablespoons - there should be much less gelatine than water!). 
4. Bring a small saucepan of water to boil. Remove from heat. Sit the bowl of gelatine in the water and stir until dissolved. Cool slightly, then stir into the cream mixture.
5. Lightly oil 6 x 1/2 cup (125ml) dariole moulds or ramekins. Place on a tray and pour in cream mixture. Refrigerate for 4 hours.

### Hints

* To serve, break the seal by inserting a small knife between the panna cotta and the mould. Turn onto a serving plate and shake to release. Serve dish with fresh berries.
* Don't use too much gelatine!!
