# Pavlova

### Ingredients

* 6 eggs (separated)
* 1 1/4 cups caster sugar
* 2 teaspoons cornflour
* 1 teaspoon white vinegar
* 600ml thickened cream
* 2 tablespoons icing sugar mixture
* Fruit (e.g. bananas, kiwifruit, passionfruit, strawberries and blueberries)

### Procedure

1. Preheat oven to 150 degrees.  Line a pizza tray with baking paper (brush with melted butter and dust with cornflour).
2. Use an electric mixer to whisk egg whites in a clean dry bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition, until meringue is thick and glossy and sugar dissolved.
3. Add cornflour, vinegar and vanilla and whisk until just combined.
4. Spoon meringue onto the foil, using the marked circle as a guide. Smooth sides and top of pavlova.
5. Bake in oven at 150 degrees for 10 mins then 120 degrees for 1 1/2 hours and an additional 80 degrees for 20 mins or until pavlova is dry to the touch.
6. Turn off oven. Leave pavlova in oven with the door ajar to cool completely. When completely cold, transfer to serving plate or store in an airtight container until required.
7. Use an electric mixer to whisk the cream and icing sugar in a medium bowl until firm peaks form. Spoon cream onto the top of pavlova.
